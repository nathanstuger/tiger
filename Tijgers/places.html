            <h3> Tiger Territory </h3>
            <p> Tigers are extremely territorial, so they will fight other animals and even other tigers that invade their space. This problem has become more of an issue due to the reduction of their natural environment. A male may have a territory of up to 60 to 100 square kilometers, while females up to 20 square kilometers, but these numbers vary according to the habitat and the subspecies. As a result of territory reduction, their areas overlap having to venture into new zones to find food.

                Some regions have a low density of tigers, such as Russia. In these cases, Tigers have vast areas for wandering, which does not occur in high-density regions such as Nepalâ€™s Chitwan National Park, where roaming areas are small and not as extensive as the average mentioned above.

                Tigers are solitary and tend to live alone. They will only be seen with other tigers when looking for a mate or in the case of females when they are taking care of their offspring. It is natural for the females to have territories that overlap those of males, which is acceptable as long as no other male tries to invade the same area.</p>
